 There's nothing real about your fight

Nothing in the shit you write

You've got charisma in your hair

The make up lady put it there, and it's

One, one plus two is three, can't we get along?

You bring it on, The Monkey Kong

 Nothing

No way

You only get it once

 6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio, radio

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out, yeah

6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band but he's got his eye on mine
There's a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time, at any time

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's okay
The daylight is that way
And we all go the same way

6 O 12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate

 Suck it up, we're going down

30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground

The passengers have lost their smiles

Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Another day, another flight

There's not a chance of going down, but I just might

So this is it, this is goodbye

And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same

But I'm going nowhere

Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way

And I really don't care 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



We're going down, we're out of sky

It sure helps if you can see the funny side

So this is over and out, this is goodbye

And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I try to reach her, but she's not there

But back home I hope she knows how much I care

I ease the seat back and start to pray

To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays  
 Suck it up, we're going down

30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground

The passengers have lost their smiles

Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Another day, another flight

There's not a chance of going down, but I just might

So this is it, this is goodbye

And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same

But I'm going nowhere

Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way

And I really don't care 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



We're going down, we're out of sky

It sure helps if you can see the funny side

So this is over and out, this is goodbye

And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I try to reach her, but she's not there

But back home I hope she knows how much I care

I ease the seat back and start to pray

To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays  
 Five pretty boys for ten shitty years

Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears

I need a reaction, a new revolution

All over the country, 'cause they took it away 



They took it away, it can't be impossible

They're playing the records that they play in hospital

Radio playlist for the terminally ill

You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing

Second-hand hits and million misses

Nobody means it, they're making up stories

You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 



I blame myself, I want an easy life

Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide

The bigger they come, the harder they fall

I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing



You suffer the pain of your fingers burning



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away

 Air on the streets, lights on the trees

Eight days a week, singer's disease

I want to be where the sun meets the sky

I want to be there, it's out of your mind

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to piece of the air when I breathe in

I want to be the gold underneath the stream

Having my moment, you know what I mean 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 



Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.

I want to stay here and never go home again

I want to be the grass underneath your feet

I want to be the shops on your high street

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to be your alarm when you sleep in

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

Get a voice, don't get a doctor

That's your choice, no-one can stop you

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud

Got a job, I don't got no pension

In it for love - money's too tight to mention

I want to be in the rockin'est city

I want to do what I want if it kills me

Have to say, your home's where you make it

It's OK, I know when you fake it

I want to be the gum on your train seat

I want to stand up and walk on my own feet

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the rock underneath your ground

I want to be the one who can make you proud

I want to be the one you can be around

 So come out fighting, second's out

Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt

Got on thing on your brain, you all act the same

But you're alright 



'Cause you are from Venus and I am from Mars

You'd like your penis as big as your car

Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!

Yeah, you're alright 



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!

You're never wrong, so bring it on

'Cause you're alright

'Cause I are from Venus and you am from Mars

You buy me panties that don't match my bras

Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to

Then it's alright

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You never listen anyway



Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you

Beating you down with my words over you

You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental

But you're alright

 It's OK to beat the living shit from the drum kit

It's OK to take what you don't have, if you want it 



That's alright, that's your way

Water's cold, December, Del Ray

Through those eyes, made me cry

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

Remember what I told ya

The night in California

And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 



It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean

It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 



Thanks a lot, you can be

What you want, honestly

Magic days, golden nights

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

All I got is best intentions

I got fears, too much to mention 



You're not there, when I'm scared, terrified

Jump right in, the water's fine

 I'm so tired, I need sleep

I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?

I make mistakes, but them's the breaks

I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)

Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 

Talk about a new world

Just not today 

Hey there, why you look so sad?

What made you so mad that you can't

You can't get over it

Hey there, why you look so hurt?

You get what you deserve, you know, here we go

Why don't you cry about it? 

Life's a bitch, and so am I

 Right back at you, record three

Makes you wish that you were me

'Cause we got no job for life

Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright

No two days turn out the same

Only sleeping on the plane

Not exactly Monkey days

C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Banshee wailing from my throat

Only dogs can hear the notes

Be myself to pay the bills

From L.A. to Skillmans Hill

We've done time for stealing shows

There ain't nothing we don't know

Plug us in and watch us go! 



C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Hot, like the desert sky

You're so cool on the inside

You hate being recognised

Going off on outside 



Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 



Coming round for one more go

Way too loud for radio

Mosh pit full of casualties

OAP's get in for free

Time to even out the score

Thought we'd done enough before

Now we're kicking down your door 



Come on, rock it up, to the back

Measure twice, cut it once

Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on!

Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 



Coming round for one more go

Way too loud for radio

Mosh pit full of casualties

OAP's get in for free

Time to even out the score

Thought we'd done enough before

Now we're kicking down your door 



Come on, rock it up, to the back

Measure twice, cut it once

Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

 Nothing

 6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio, radio

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out, yeah

6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band but he's got his eye on mine
There's a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time, at any time

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's okay
The daylight is that way
And we all go the same way

6 O 12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone

Get out, get out, get out, yeah
Get out, get out, get out

When my knees don't work I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate

 Suck it up, we're going down

30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground

The passengers have lost their smiles

Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Another day, another flight

There's not a chance of going down, but I just might

So this is it, this is goodbye

And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same

But I'm going nowhere

Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way

And I really don't care 



I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I think that this might hurt a bit

I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 



We're going down, we're out of sky

It sure helps if you can see the funny side

So this is over and out, this is goodbye

And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 



I try to reach her, but she's not there

But back home I hope she knows how much I care

I ease the seat back and start to pray

To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays

 Five pretty boys for ten shitty years

Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears

I need a reaction, a new revolution

All over the country, 'cause they took it away 



They took it away, it can't be impossible

They're playing the records that they play in hospital

Radio playlist for the terminally ill

You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing

Second-hand hits and million misses

Nobody means it, they're making up stories

You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 



I blame myself, I want an easy life

Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide

The bigger they come, the harder they fall

I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing



You suffer the pain of your fingers burning



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on)

And it goes on (and on, and on, and on) 



If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away

 Air on the streets, lights on the trees

Eight days a week, singer's disease

I want to be where the sun meets the sky

I want to be there, it's out of your mind

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to piece of the air when I breathe in

I want to be the gold underneath the stream

Having my moment, you know what I mean 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 



Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.

I want to stay here and never go home again

I want to be the grass underneath your feet

I want to be the shops on your high street

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to be your alarm when you sleep in

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 



Get a voice, don't get a doctor

That's your choice, no-one can stop you

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one who can make you proud

Got a job, I don't got no pension

In it for love - money's too tight to mention

I want to be in the rockin'est city

I want to do what I want if it kills me

Have to say, your home's where you make it

It's OK, I know when you fake it

I want to be the gum on your train seat

I want to stand up and walk on my own feet

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the rock underneath your ground

I want to be the one who can make you proud

I want to be the one you can be around

I want to be the one you can be around  
 Air on the streets, lights on the trees

Eight days a week, singer's disease

I want to be where the sun meets the sky

I want to be there, it's out of your mind

And I believe in the secrets you're keeping

I want to piece of the air when I breathe in

I want to be the gold underneath the stream

Having my moment, you know what I mean 



Oh, it's a blue sky

And the headlights, and the headlines

It's a new day, for a new wave

It's a perfect moment, oh

I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs

 So come out fighting, second's out

Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt

Got on thing on your brain, you all act the same

But you're alright 



'Cause you are from Venus and I am from Mars

You'd like your penis as big as your car

Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!

Yeah, you're alright 



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You never listen anyway 



It's the way that you're scratching your balls when you walk

You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!

You're never wrong, so bring it on

'Cause you're alright

'Cause I are from Venus and you am from Mars

You buy me panties that don't match my bras

Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to

Then it's alright



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

You never listen anyway



Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you

Beating you down with my words over you

You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental

But you're alright



It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face

I bet you think you know the place

It's just as far as you can go, without going back again

 It's OK to beat the living shit from the drum kit

It's OK to take what you don't have, if you want it 



That's alright, that's your way

Water's cold, December, Del Ray

Through those eyes, made me cry

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

Remember what I told ya

The night in California

And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 



It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean

It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 



Thanks a lot, you can be

What you want, honestly

Magic days, golden nights

And the summer is forever

It's the endless summer 



And it's not about your girlfriend

And it's not about your boyfriend

And I'm not about to lose it over you

Remember what I told ya

The night in California

And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 



I don't need no explanation

All I got is best intentions

I got fears, too much to mention 



You're not there, when I'm scared, terrified

Jump right in, the water's fine

 We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go

It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! 



Running out of luck

Trying to keep it punk

You can only let yourself down

Afraid of what you know

A square shape in a round hole

You know, it goes in tight,

Goes in tight



We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go

It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?



You're running out of time

You're never going nowhere

The best is all behind you

You're spending your cash like a man with no hands

Keepin' it real like your favourite bands

If they don't try

Then we don't buy, we don't buy



It's the distance, it's the distance

It's the distance, the position between me and you

So stand up, so get up

So stand up, so get up

 I'm so tired, I need sleep

I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?

I make mistakes, but them's the breaks

I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 

Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)

Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 

Talk about a new world

Just not today 

Hey there, why you look so sad?

What made you so mad that you can't

You can't get over it

Hey there, why you look so hurt?

You get what you deserve, you know, here we go

Why don't you cry about it? 

Life's a bitch, and so am I

If you want it bad enough, there's lots of easy ways to die

No homies, so lonely

Why don't you cry about it now?

 Right back at you, record three

Makes you wish that you were me

'Cause we got no job for life

Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright

No two days turn out the same

Only sleeping on the plane

Not exactly Monkey days

C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Banshee wailing from my throat

Only dogs can hear the notes

Be myself to pay the bills

From L.A. to Skillmans Hill

We've done time for stealing shows

There ain't nothing we don't know

Plug us in and watch us go! 



C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, bring it on! 



Hot, like the desert sky

You're so cool on the inside

You hate being recognised

Going off on outside 



Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out

Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 



Coming round for one more go

Way too loud for radio

Mosh pit full of casualties

OAP's get in for free

Time to even out the score

Thought we'd done enough before

Now we're kicking down your door 



Come on, rock it up, to the back

Measure twice, cut it once

Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 



So get your, so get your ears on

So get your, so get your ears on

'Cause I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi

I'm serious, so come on 



So get your, so get your ears on

 Nothing

And nothing's where you're at

 Met a man who said he's got a villa down in Africa

I asked him what he's doing here, the weather sucks, what's wrong with ya?



He said he's got a gun, and that he's on the run

He used to have a life but it went wrong



Girlfriend's in a coma

He's promised to look after her

He's written to her favourite bands

He's hoping for Metallica



It all looks pretty grim

He wishes it were him

He used to have a life but it went wrong



And he said

Hey, what you living for?

Hey, what you looking for?

I'm not gonna take it any more

Is anybody there? Is anybody out?

Is anybody up? Is anybody down?



I don't think I can take it any more

I don't think I can take it any more



She's cruising in her wheelchair

She's dressed up like [a mexican]

She's holding up the traffic and there's gonna be an accident



I bet she lives alone

Is anybody home?

She used to have a life but it went wrong



And she says

Hey, what you living for?

Hey, what you learning for?

I'm not gonna take it any more

 I have fallen down a manhole

Up the river without paddle

I can't stand up on my own feet

Something came along and bit me



You're all over the place

When she wipes that grin off your face

And you don't know what day it is

Don't even know your name



She's getting me off

She's turning me on

I hope she does that to herself, when I am gone



I don't get the situation

We're an overnight sensation



You feel like you could drop

But she's coming ready or not

And you don't know the place to start, you don't know where to stop



She's getting me off

She's turning me on

I hope she does that to herself, when I am gone



She's checking me out

I'm losing the fight, yeah

I'm so retarded for that girl, and that's alright



You're all over the place

When she wipes that grin off your face

And you don't know what day it is

Don't even know your name

It's so great, I want to stay home every night

 As we grow up I feel the tension

Its all around me

I can't explain this apprehension

And then its the next day

This state of mind

I fail to define

Forced to contend like you

Watch that your not silenced too 

We can dissent

Yeah, we can change ourselves

But don't pretend

Prioritize your values 

I've reached a point of deep despondence

It premeates me

A constant weigh upon my conscience

Now we've gotta change

The way we act

We should watch each others backs

Global equality at the expensive of state economies 

Let go

 I wonder wonder wonder
Wonder what went wrong
We used to used to used to 
Used to feel so strong
Now we seem to come apart at the seam
Now we speak impolitely
Now it's a fight to be nice
And you know it ain't right

I remember member member
Member what we had
We used to used to used to
Used to love so madly
Now we speak impolitely
Now we struggle even nightly

Who is replaceable
Who is reciprocal
Who is responsible

 On and on like a rush song, like a long one
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah, the right one
There will come a day when I'll bury you
I will go the same way, together
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through

And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough

Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming
Emo boy, naive and semi functioning
Hey, this is a love song, hands up if you feel it

 You like snow but only if it's warm

You like rain but only if it's dry

There's no sentimental value to the rose that fell on your floor

There's no fundamental excuse for the granted I'm taken for



'Cause it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you



You like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much

And you sit, and you wait, to receive

There's an obvious attraction

To the path of least resistance in your life

Well there's an obvious aversion no amount of my insistence

Could make you try tonight



'Cause it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you

To you, to you, to you, to you, to you



There's no love, no money, no thrill anymore



There's an apprehensive naked little trembling boy

With his head in his hands

And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl

Raising her hand



But it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you

To you, to you



Get up, get up, get up off of it

Get up, get up, get up off of it

Get out, get outta here, enough already

Get up, get up, get up off of it

Wake up  
 You like snow but only if it's warm

 Some days go on forever, 

Last long into the night, 

Some days feel like December, although its warm on the inside. 

Forget the middle of summer, 

I bet you I am alive. 

We'll wipe the floors together, nice try. 



Save it all, 

You have all the answers, 

Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 

Crying out, 

You have all the anger, 

Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 

You're a black hole! 



Some days are complicated, 

Some ways i'll take the blame, 

Some days i take it all to, heart again. 

This place is made of panic, 

They check you every mile, 

Thank god you're going out for, a while.

Crying out, 

You have all the anger, 

Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 

You're a black hole! 

You're a black hole! 

You're a black hole!  
 Hang on, don't be frightened, 

Hold on, keep the light on, 

You call me anytime you want to. 

Keep a night in summer, 

Don't cry when its over, 

You take me anywhere you need to. 



Like its your birthday, 

Like on your first date, 



Hey! You're gonna make it in your own way! 

You're gonna make it in your own way! 

Hey! You gotta make it in your own way! 

Or you're gonna fall... 



Come on, getting violent, 

Be strong, and don't be frightened, 

That's crazy talk where out from hold you lost this. 

Go where the weather takes you, 

Don't care, they'll never break you, 

Love is all we needed in the first place.

 Standing with a headache
I try to fight but I can't deny the pain
Reservations what I got
From the bottom to the top

On the bottle, 5 times a day
Standing with the top line
You know it's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm shaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen?

You're bored out of ya mind
Fighting all the time
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?

When there's nothing on
You find yourself caught in the spotlight
You try to fight but you can't delight the phase
On your knees is what you're not

Keeping what you got
Don't try to hide your face, caught in a flashlight
You know it's gonna hurt when I close my eyes
And I'm breaking and I feel so alive

Stand up and face it
Get up, don't waste it

Do you know the people fighting for your head?

What you think, the things you read and what you see.

What you hear and how you choose

your buy from wrong.

Yeah I hear the sound of a coming new wave.



Have you ever been lonely?

Afraid to speak your mind?

Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?



Now I know the reasons for the other side,

and I see a different point of view this time.

I will be a stronger person if I try.

I will see the other side of this day.



Are they really controlling

the way you use your mind?

Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?

You can dance, you can jive

Having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene

Dig in the Dancing Queen



Friday night and the lights are low

Looking out for a place to go

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing

You come to look for a king

Anyone could be that guy

The night is young, and the music's high

Playing bluegrass music, and everything is fine

You're in the mood to dance

And when you get the chance



You are the Dancing Queen

Young and sweet, only seventeen

Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive

Having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene

Dig in the Dancing Queen



You're a teaser, you turn 'em on

Leave 'em burning, and then you're gone

Looking for another, anyone will do

   I signed my name with a smile

X marked the spot on the edge of denial



I got a deal one for two

And you said youll never have to settle on you.



I met the king of the rain

Love for the pain? I heard them say.

Here take my hands, wash them clean.

Cause Im not the man I thought I dreamed.



Sometimes Im dumb but Ill never be numb

I can feel you.

You fill me like fire in my veins,

And Im free cause youre holding me down.



I might be lame but you move me the same

I can see you.

Its a scene like stars in the day.

And Im free cause youre holding me down.



I threw my conscious away.

Ive got my reasons, my problems today.

I turn and my heart skips a beat.

I see you running, smiling, welcoming me.



I might be dumb but Ill never be numb

I can feel you.

You fill me like fire in my veins,

And Im free cause youre holding me down.



I might be lame but inside Im the same.

You know Ive crawled for a mile.

And Ive got pain, take it away.

What, tssh, why'all, what

Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh

Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh

The G, Roc-A-Fella why'all



Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi

Drinking saki, it's me, and my mami with the doobie

Cutie, smellin like Tiaka, half-Philippine thing

For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin

Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance

A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy

Tastes Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ

Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me

Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early

Cause who's gettin played is not me

"Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely

Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"

I said maturely, "You right

But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds

Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story

To make sure that you one of a kind

And you deserve to be my Sunshine"



Chorus: Babyface (variations not listed except for first time)

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)

I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)

Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)

I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)



[Jay-Z], (Foxy Brown)

A year gone, and she seein things most chicks only

Hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom

Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)

Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm

Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)

Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said



[Foxy Brown], (Jay-Z)

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggaz stressin

Hatin cause they less than mine, they want to sex me

We chose each other, you actin like you chose me

They oppose you then, they oppose me

We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery

Double cross you they got to triple cross me

(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh

(One more thing:

If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'

(She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh

(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life

(Right)



Chorus

[Jay-Z], (Foxy Brown)

If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho')

Catch a case you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho')

Pawn your jewlery to come get me? (You better know)

Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know)

They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)

They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)

(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof at Zales'

That you was, throwin rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?)

This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail

I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale

Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell

Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin myself

Now picture me leavin you in this cold world, rollin for delf

It's me and you in this old girl, we takin the belt

From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine

Just continue to be my Sunshine (uhhh)

   Driving in the poring rain
Wishing you would wash away
Thought I left you far behind
Back when we both said goodbye
Your in every face I see
Even strangers on the street
You live in this radio
There's nowhere that I can go

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I would walk across the world
A million miles from what we were
If that would free me from your chains
Help me forget your name

try to run I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I can't shake you 
I can't make you go away
And I can't take this haunting me for one more day

try to run, I try to hide
Leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
But like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me
 
   Driving in the poring rain
Wishing you would wash away
Thought I left you far behind
Back when we both said goodbye
Your in every face I see
Even strangers on the street
You live in this radio
There's nowhere that I can go

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I would walk across the world
A million miles from what we were
If that would free me from your chains
Help me forget your name

try to run I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me

I can't shake you 
I can't make you go away
And I can't take this haunting me for one more day

try to run, I try to hide
Leave your memory behind
Like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me

try to run, I try to hide
I leave your memory behind
But like a shadow you won't leave
I take you everywhere with me
Take you everywhere with me
 
   Jenny said when she was just five years old

You know there's nothing happenin' at all

Every time she puts on the radio

There was nothing going down at all

Then one fine mornin' she puts on a new york station

She couldn't believe what she heard at all

She started dancin' to that fine fine music

You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll



Despite all the amputations

You could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station

And it was alright

My parents are gonna be the death of us all

Two tv sets and two cadillac cars

Time has made me strong



Yeah it's been a long time waiting

Waiting for this day to come

Time don't wait so I keep singing



Yeah it's been a long time coming

Never thought it'd take so long

I stood still but time kept running

Time has made me strong

Made me strong, made me strong

Time has made me strong 
   Yeah it's been a long time coming

Never thought it'd take so long

I stood still but time kept running

Time has made me strong



Yeah it's been a long time waiting

Waiting for this day to come

Time don't wait so I keep singing



Yeah it's been a long time coming

Never thought it'd take so long

I stood still but time kept running

Time has made me strong

Made me strong, made me strong

Time has made me strong 
   The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright

I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight

I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis

Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See

The bell rang and I got my dash

Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed

No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'

To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'

The downtown scene was packed

People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I 

says I am what I am that's who I be

And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me

Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are

who we are to this very day

And all that love keeps me and Kris tight

Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

 

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood

And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good

Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades

Some pants like nike's gee

Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin' 

I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man

Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can

Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody

dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good

Cause, I'm down like four flat tires

Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'

I can do right and not do wrong

Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong

and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that

love us back right.

 

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on

the road and I'm makin' some cash

But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids

tryin' to make it in this here biz

Early morning interviews, then we step to school

Step from School, back to interviews

then it's on to other dues

So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris

That's what I was born to do

 

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if

the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right

See I ain't come out wack, I came out right

Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic

It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real

but you want to want to diss because 

A nigga sold a couple of mil

Look here

You can't say nothing if you're last in the line

So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind

And it's Alright

   [Wyclef]

I want to send this one out to my vanilla ice-cream chocolate pudding pie

That stayed with me in the hood, do or die

Refugee camp



[Sharissa]

Yeah, this one goes out to my arm and joy

My banana that never split

The one that stuck with me



[Wyclef]

Before I had the bling bling

I thought I'd hit up in Sing Sing

Who would have ever thought that we'd be doing our thing

I know I did a little cheating

But once I got caught

I send you a parcel of roses

You sent them back and told me go to hell



[Wyclef]

But girl you know that, you take me as I am

Even though my fam don't understand

Why I put that rock up on your hand

That's 'cause you take me as I am (take me as I am)



[Sharissa] (Wyclef)

You take me as I am (yeah, I'm a take you as you are)

Even when my girls can't understand

I choose you as my man

[Wyclef] (Sharrissa)

You're my girl (my man)

You're my girl (my man)

You're my lady (my man)

You're my baby



[Sharissa]

When I was rocking jelly and had a little belly

Who woulda ever thought, you'd think I was sexy

I say it with an attitude, I admit I came off rude

But still you love me, I know I get on your nerves sometimes



[Sharissa]

And I don't know why you take me as I am

Even when my girls can't understand

I choose you as my man (my man, yeah)

Cause you take me as I am (take me as I am)



[Sharrissa]

You take me as I am, girl I'm a take you as you are

You take me as I am, girl I'm a take you as you are

Even though my fam don't understand

Cause I take you as you are, you're a star

Bring Noise Nigga, I got something on my shoulder - that bitch is so heavy
AK-47 a test ta a Mac-11, double clipped taped up
Ready ta spray something, 175 shots ta clear the block
I've rob through your neighborhood, day and night
Stole clothes people inside, ya hood on strike
I'm looking, for ya - high and low, nigga I'm searchin'
11 deep in the new Ford Excursion
Me and my nigga P. - brother D's on weed
Bet should re-infact, k' pot it clean
Once you found you get down, burn torchin' and beat
That's the treatment you get from a nigga in C.M.B.
I'm the B.G. but you can call me - Shot 'em up shorty
I'll get mad and try ta flush your head down the toirlet
Baby gave me the game - when this niggaz that's bitch made
Gimme my props, call it Ace a Ace a spade of spades nigga

[Juvenile]
Boss you wouldn't believe what happend ta me
Last night I got hit for a package of ki's
Who was it? Man I'ont know some cats
They kicked in my doo' shot my wife in the back
And you think them mothafuckers woulda left it at that
They beat me in my head until I said where it's at
Okay we go out in the streets and we get the word
We hit up anybody that we think selling them birds
Them fuckin moolignanis don't want no war'
C4 them down, let 'em burn in the car
Me not worried about no witness
'cause them won't see, anything linkin' up ta me
Boss, come ta find out it was Red and Black
Them connivin' motherfuckers gatta pay for that
I tell you what I gonna do, burn them cock roaches
And payment for the cops in case they wanna approach us

[Baby]
I'm the O.G. nigga 'bout money and bitches
Know how, ta flip a brick and deal with ditches
My brother K.C. told me how ta kill these niggaz
While Troy had me in alleys dealin' with digits
Aiy, life is real my nigga, me and Lac pa' was killed my nigga
It ain't nothing keep it real my nigga
While my homies carve life in the field my nigga
Ski' then family - thrill deal niggaz
Rambo and Sam - it is what it is niggaz
I've robbed niggaz - pulled triggers for niggaz
Drama's involved - we in like we in nigga
Homicide - we kill like we kill nigga
Behind them thangs - it is what it is niggaz
Birdman - a known shotcaller
Suburban man and Benzes and Prowlers


[Lil' Wayne]
(look - look - look - look)
Here comes Mister Bad nerves
What that fed up look?
Shorty got that do whatever for the cheddar look
And got no dope, weed or fetti plus I'm hurt and hungry
All I got is this beretta with 2 murders on it
I done walk 'bout four blocks
In a pair of old 'Boks
Dirty with no socks
Looking for dope spots
Man I'm on the prawl - untamed and wild
Been a year since I smiled
Better watch that child
Hat over my eyes, you can't see my frustation
Looking at niggaz paper chasin' with mean faces
Was told wait my turn - but damn I'm in-pacient
Pacin' the streets, with, the, mac-10 blazin'
Lil' Brother bail please, I'ma kill him for the scrilla
Do you under smell me - I'm telling your dawg
I was raised on bad ways from school on half-days
Have smart and have praise - stop playin' with me

[Turk]
It's in my bloodstream wodie, ta be the nigga that I am
Tote gats with hats take a nigga from his fam'
Nothin' but streets shit - it's all a nigga know
Knockin you off ya feet quick - it's all a nigga know
Drive-bys in you-Hauls - prepared anyday
Thuggin' is usual, do that every day
Bitch niggaz get roast, if your not from round my way
Middle of the court or one of them hallways
Quick ta steal ya, I'm real I ain't fake
Leave ya ass a murder scene in the middle of yellow tape
Put a hole in ya thinkin' cap, won't be thinkin no mo'
You'll be put ta nap
Young nigga play it raw, raw - X ya bitch ass out
Me and my nigga Rat quick ta run up in ya house
Fuck it, I goes out 'cause it's in me my nigga
When it's a coke drought - I tote a semi my nigga

My friend well he walked me down

These roads I've never known

The salvation of my soul 

Myself the only goal

There were pleasures I thought I'd seen

And some I never knew

There were people dressed in rainments

Of an uncertain hue

And the chances I thought I'd had

Many I'd missed

There were devils bearing gifts

And angels on the piss



For my sins I will confess

And I will never lie

There's nobody that was ever here

That's never wondered why

And I've lived my life the best

Every second to defy

Will nobody that was ever here

Grieve me when I die



On the first day I met myself 

Coming back from the third

I believed in what I was doing

I swallowed every word

Every word that I was told

By the great and the good

I bit the poisoned apple 

'cause I felt that I should



And now that I come to it 

I can't recall

What it was I achieved

Just before my fall

I saw visions of ugliness 

I visited shame

But I know should I come to it 

I'd do it all again

   There's a blank space in this photograph

I don't remember what made me laugh

I'm not happy, though I seem to be

Where your face should have been

Only whispering wind



I don't care anymore

If you say it's the end

I'll still be your best friend

I don't care if you're cruel

I don't care if you're dead

I'll still be your best friend



So don't cry, rainy eyes, I'll carry on

When all the honest people are gone

But you gave up ~whoa~ so easy

On the noise that we made

Something gold that could stay



I don't care if your gun has

A bullet for me

I really mean it, you

Still need a best friend 



There's a blank space in this photograph

I don't remember what made me laugh



I don't care anymore

If you say it's the end

I'll still be your best friend

I don't care if you

Flake out all over again

I'll still be your best friend



Oh, you still need a best friend

Oh, you still need a best friend 
   Where you're at

You shouldn't be

Although I wish I was there too

Back and forth

Through the course

Of the last few years

My mind is not made up

Still

Do you lie



To everyone

You don't have to lie to me

Is your sight

Without light

You can't see me in the dark

When will I start working for me

When will I stand tall like the trees

Am I just paying for sin

Still 
   Where you're at

You shouldn't be

Although I wish I was there too

Back and forth

Through the course

Of the last few years

My mind is not made up

Still

Do you lie

You can't see me in the dark

When will I start working for me

When will I stand tall like the trees

Am I just paying for sin

Still 
   I set the fire ablaze

Lit it from far away

Found it out yesterday

Called it a big mistake

A wake up call for me

Figured it would be

That the story of this man

Never was a plan

Incompatible worlds we can't control

But that's the way it's always been

Circumstantial human beings

By the way I'll be ok

So why aren't you the first to say

Today I'm born again

Call it a big mistake

To see it fade away

But the problem's not with me

So now I'm twenty two

Feeling kind of blue

Because the same thing's happening

Instead it's now my friends

The choices we all make

Could prove life long mistakes

But I don't want to see your life fall right on through your hands

By the way I'll be ok

So why aren't you the first to say

I wish this never happened

I wonder what my life would be like now

If things just kind of went my way

Today you're born again

So now you're twenty-one

With no worries

Now you're twenty-one

With no worries

Now you're twenty-one

Only twenty-one years young

   When lady luck has got me down with her high-speed attitude 

I'm-a feeling kinda high I'm-a feeling kinda low 

I feel so, I dunno like fast food 

Someone spiked my latte and I'm just not in the mood 

Need a little bit of this, need a little bit of that 

Some chit chat and that's why I'm the dude 



I got a feeling 

Something's wrong 

I dial your number 

And then it's gone 

I got a feeling 

Something's whack 

Before I count to three 

You're here with me before the blues attack 



Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek 

Without you girl the future's bleak 

Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek 

I want you by my side 

Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek 

You got a day, it's like the week 

Hip, hip to hip, cheek, cheek to cheek 

I'm feeling good inside 



When lady luck is dressed in black 

And I'm dancing in my shoes 

Tryna pull me to the left tryna pull me to the right 

I just might, sit tight stay in my groove 

I'm tired of people on my back 

Making offers I can't refuse 

I know that they believe I'm on my knees 

But I know I won't ever leave yeah 



I got a feeling 

Something's wrong

Twist it, nation 

Meet the generation 

We don't need no education 

The rhythm that you're giving me is changing my life 

And baby if you said jump I'd say how high 

No dealing, stealing 

Only free-wheeling 

You're giving a religion for me to believe in 

So rock me, shock me any way you know 

But I guess I kinda like the status quo

   Hope climbs atop of the piano

Reaching out towards the warmth of the sun

Some man tries to ask her down

But now maybe that's where she belongs

My God she said,

I'm the sunflower who wants

My god he said,

This woman is gone

Into the dark

Is there anybody there

My god she said

He climbed up top to find that she was slipping

Let her go, let her go, let me go

How long must we leave before we're winning

They don't know, they don't know they just don't know

If she can't be there I know it's best that

Nothing is denied

If she can't be there it's best that

Everyone change sides

In my mind, in my mind 

A world of enchantment

Being sung through my mind

In my mind, visual enhancement



And I find myself 

In a red painted barn

A million stars 

They pick me up and spin me



And now I am floating 

In a land of confusion

Or is it reality 

Or just an illusion

And nothing makes sense

No start and no end

When you get more

Is when you get bored



In my mind, in my mind

Turning the handle 

And it's starting to stain

In my mind burns like a candle



And the wax tells a fairy tale

My head's for sale

I'm swimming through the hail



And now I am floating 

In a land of confusion

Or is it reality 

Or just an illusion

And nothing makes sense
